## Architectural Design

### Overview

The main goal of this project was to develop an easily extensible, modular management dashboard for the cocktail robot developed by the TUM CIT Chair based on a [CPEE](https://cpee.org/) model. The requirements for the project stipulate that the system should persist the logs resulting from the CPEE process in a SQLite database and, in the next step, be connected to a web-based dashboard via a Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection. In this way, this project provides an extensible and easily scalable system that gives the user feedback on the actions of one or more cocktail robots in real time. Further architectural details of this project can be found in the following graphic:

### Components

This project incorporates the following components: 

1. **Simulator:** The CPEE process `CPEE_Cocktail_Dashboard_Process.xml` serves as a simulator that generates data on the actions of the cocktail robot in its typical working environment. This means: setting up the robot, receiving and accepting orders, preparing and serving cocktails and switching off. Please refer to the next chapter for further information. 
2. **Logger:** The Python script `persist_logs_in_sqlite.py` serves as an interface between the logging interface of CPEE and the backend. Event logs that are generated while the simulator is running are parsed and persisted in a SQLite database (`log_database.db`) located on the server [lehre.bpm.in.tum.de](https://lehre.bpm.in.tum.de/).  
3. **Dashboard Backend:** The Python script `backend_cocktail_dashboard.py` includes a Flask Python web framework that prepares relevant logs as soon as new logs are written to the database. It therefore constantly searches the database for updates in order to send new data to the frontend (SSE).
4. **Dashboard Frontend:** The html script `frontend_cocktail_dashboard.html` visualizes the logs in a user-friendly and comprehensive way that allows developers and non-developers to get an overview of the status of one or more cocktail robots and various relevant statistics. The dashboard is limited to view-only functionalities, which meets the requirements of the project.

## Installation

A step-by-step guide to setting up this project can be found below. Please refer to this [video](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/docs/00_Cocktail_Dashboard_Installation.mp4) for further details. 

1. Navigate and log into your account space on the server [lehre.bpm.in.tum.de](https://lehre.bpm.in.tum.de/)
2. Clone the repository with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard`

3. Navigate into the projcet folder and install the required packages with the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Navigate into the `src` folder and create a SQLite database with the following commands:

`touch log_database.db`

`chmod 666 log_database.db`

5. *If required:* Adjust the link `db_path` in the scripts `persist_logs_in_sqlite.py` and `backend_cocktail_dashboard.py` to point to the database you created on your server space

6. Run the project with the following commands:

`python3 persist_logs_in_sqlite.py` to persist logs that are generated by the CPEE model in SQLite

`python3 backend_cocktail_dashboard.py` to set up and send the event logs to a web dashboard 

7. The dashboard can be accessed at the configured port.
8. Create a new instance on [CPEE](https://cpee.org/) and load the [CPEE model](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/cpee_model/CPEE_Cocktail_Dashboard_Process.xml). Note that multiple instances can be created, which means that "multiple robots can work simultaneously".
9. Start one or more CPEE models and watch the Dashboard's magic.

## CPEE Model

The [CPEE model](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/cpee_model/CPEE_Cocktail_Dashboard_Process.xml) serves as a simulator of a single cocktail robot and is designed to be extendable by more detailed (sub)processes in future projects. It is possible to start several processes in parallel, which would mean that several cocktail robots work simultaneously. Note that the process is based on local data elements that control the process, e.g. by determining the fill levels of ingredients or by randomly selecting cocktail orders. However, the dashboard functions without relying on these local data elements but rather on "annotations" assigned to each process step in CPEE. Please refer to the chapter "Process Logs" for further information. 

### Process Flow

The CPEE process at hand implements the basic functionalities of a cocktail robot, which consist of the following actions: 

#### 1. Setting up the robot

![alt text](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/docs/01_cpee_model_doc_setting_up_the_robot.png)

The process uses a random parameter to decide whether the robot builds up (boots) successfully or whether it "crashes" and shuts down (see Step 5). The latter results in a new reboot. If the robot boots successfully, the process continues to Step 2.  

#### 2. Getting an order

![alt text](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/docs/02_cpee_model_doc_getting_an_order.png)

The process "orders" a cocktail at random, i.e. in this example Gin Tonic, Negroni or Old Fashioned. There is also a chance that a cocktail will be ordered that is not on the "menu", i.e. for which no process/recipe is defined. In this case, refer to Step 4. If the cocktail is "on the menu", the process continues with Step 3. 

#### 3. Preparing a cocktail or filling up the ingredients

![alt text](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/docs/03_cpee_model_preparing_cocktail_or_fill_up_ingredients.png)

The system checks whether the ingredients are sufficient to make the cocktail ordered. If so, the cocktail recipe, as implemented into the process, is executed, whereby the addition of an ingredient, e.g. Angostura to an Old Fashioned, is a process step. Finally, each cocktail is "mixed and served". If the level of any of the required ingredients is insufficient, the process selects the alternative lane, i.e. rejecting the order and replenishing the ingredients. The process continues with Step 5.

#### 4. Cocktail is unavailable

![alt text](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/docs/04_cpee_model_cocktail_unavailable.png)

If the order from Step 2 results in a cocktail that is not available, i.e. for which no process is defined, the order is rejected and the process continues with Step 5.

#### 5. Finishing an order and shutting down

![alt text](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/docs/05_cpee_model_finishing_an_order_and_shutting_down.png)

In both cases, i.e. when an order has been successfully executed or rejected, the process ends the current order cycle by resetting various status variables that are required for the process to run in an endless simulation loop. Here too, the process randomly determines whether the robot can continue working, i.e. accepts the next order (jump to Step 2), or whether it "crashes" and has to be switched off. In the latter case, the robot shuts down and rebuilds itself (Step 1). Conclusively, this process runs in an endless loop. 

To summarize, the CPEE model is designed to generate data for demonstration porpuses and to be easily scalable. As the dashboard is not based on the data elements of the process, but on the annotations associated with the different process elements, the dashboard is robust to changes in the names of individual data elements, for example. These 'annotations' are a CPEE feature enabling more efficient logging by abstracting single process steps. The dashboard backend and frontend heavily relies on these annotations as can be seen in the following chapters. 

### Process Logs

Process logs produced by a CPEE process can be accessed via the so-called Logging Service [(Mangler & Rinderle-Ma, 2022)](https://i17vm1.in.tum.de/zotero/R2624EE2.pdf). A typical downside of working with logs could be that they are very specific to a process and that malfunctions may occur in later applications even if small changes are made in the process. This project addresses this problem by relying on generic "annotations" instead of logging data element changes. 

![alt text](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/docs/06_cpee_model_logs.png)

There is a set of annotation keys defined for the CPEE process at hand:

- `dashboard_robot_status` describes status changes of the cocktail robot and takes values such as "Setting up...", "Accepting order", or "Preparing ingredients"
- `dashboard_process_status` describes the overall process status and takes values such as "started" or "finished"
- `dashboard_cocktail_stats` provides information about which cocktail was ordered and takes values such as "Gin Tonic", "Negroni", or "Old Fasioned"
- `dashboard_item_used` provides information about which ingredients were used for a cocktail and takes values such as "Gin", "Tonic", or "Angostura"

These four annotation keys are enough to model and visualize the whole process in the next step. Moreover, they make the process easily extensible. For instance, one could add an additional recipe (subprocess) for, say, Mojito by simply specifying new values for the annotation `dashboard_cocktail_stats`, i.e. "Mojito", and `dashboard_item_used`, i.e. "Rum", "Soda", "Lime", etc. Nothing needs to be changed in the subsequent code elements as they rely solely on the key not the value elements of the logs - the backend would seamlessly incorporate this new cocktail type and display it in the frontend.

### Dashboard Elements

![alt text](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/docs/00_dashboard_overview.png)

The product of this project is a web dashboard that is updated in real-time as one or more underlying CPEE processes are in action. The dashboard incorportas the following elements (top to bottom, left to right): 

- **Last reset: 29.03.2024, 11:04:33**: The dashboard resets as soon as the underlying SQLite database is reset. All statistics are set to 0. The date of the last reset is displayed at the top. 
- **Cocktails made since last reset**: This number increases by one each time there is a new log entry with the annotation key `dashboard_cocktail_stats`.
- **Ingredients used since last reset**: This number increases by one each time there is a new log entry with the annotation key `dashboard_item_used`.
- **Robot failures since last reset**: This number increases by one each time there is a new log entry where the annotation key `dashboard_cocktail_stats` indicates that the robot crashed, e.g., "The Robot crashed. Shutting down...".
- **Current Status of Robot: ...**: The current status of a single robot (identified by its `instance_uuid`) is displayed here. The dashboard can display an infinite number of individual robot statuses.
- ***Barchart:* Number of Cocktails Made**: Depending on the value of `dashboard_cocktail_stats`, a new bar appears in the diagram, which increases by one each time the corresponding value is received as a new log.
- ***Barchart:* Ingredients Used**: Depending on the value of `dashboard_item_used`, a new bar appears in the diagram, which increases by one each time the corresponding value is received as a new log.

### Dashboard in Action

The functionalities of the dashboard are best demonstrated in this [video](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/docs/07_Cocktail_Dashboard_Functionality-Demonstration.mp4): 

- *00:00*: A single CPEE process instance has been created (see Chapter "Installation" for more details) and the present process has been executed. This means that a single robot starts its work by "Setting up..." and accepts orders in the next step.
- *00:10*: A first order came in, a "Gin Tonic", which the robot picked up and prepared the desired ingredients, i.e. "gin" and "tonic". The respective statistics and bar charts adjust in the dashboard are adjusted in real-time.
- *00:26*: A second CPEE process instance has been created meaning that a second robot starts to work. As soon as the second process started, a second robot appeared on the dashboard stating its `instance_uuid`.
- *00:55*: The first robot, i.e. the first process created, is stopped (exactly at *01:02*) and the robot stops working immediately. The status displayed on the dashboard remains unchanged for one minute as long as the robot does not resume its work. Meanwhile, the second robot continues to take orders and make cocktails, occasionally shutting down and setting up itself. The process continues displaying any process changes in real-time.
- *02:02*: One minute after the first process is stopped, the system recognizes that this robot appears to be out of order and the dashboard sets its status to "** Out of order**". If the robot does not resume its work within four minutes, the system excludes this robot completely from the dashboard.

A second [video](https://github.com/AlexMR2000/Cocktail_Dashboard/blob/main/docs/08_Cocktail_Dashboard_Real-Time-Demonstration.mp4) demonstrates the real-time capability of the dashboard by showing both the CPEE process and the dashboard in action.

## API Documentation

### Logger

The application `persist_logs_to_sqlite.py` serves as a logging service, capturing event data sent through HTTP `POST` requests to a specified endpoint Â´/writelogtodbÂ´. It processes the incoming data and stores it in a structured format within an SQLite database. The service is built using the Flask Python web framework making it lightweight and suitable for both development and production environments.

#### Application Setup

The database is configured to store logs in a table called "logs", which contains various fields such as "timestamp_log", "event", "instance_uuid" (to uniquely identify a single process, i.e. a robot), and `annotations` among others. The Â´setup_databaseÂ´ function is responsible for creating this table if it does not already exist.

#### Endpoint 

The endpoint `/writelogtodb` accepts `POST` requests containing event log data. The data is expected to be in a form-encoded format with a key named `notification` holding a JSON string of the event details [(Mangler & Rinderle-Ma, 2022)](https://i17vm1.in.tum.de/zotero/R2624EE2.pdf). The application parses this data, along with other form fields, to extract relevant information.

#### Key Functions

- `get_db_connection()` establishes a connection to the SQLite database and sets the row factory to `sqlite3.Row` for convenient row access.
- `setup_database()` ensures the existence of the `logs` table within the database, creating it with the appropriate schema if necessary.
- `write_log_to_db()` is the main function for processing incoming `POST` requests. It extracts data from the request, formats it appropriately, and inserts it into the logs table in the database. In case of errors during database operations, it returns an HTTP 500 response.

#### Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling, particularly for database operations within the `write_log_to_db` function. Errors are caught, logged to the console, and result in an HTTP 500 response to indicate a server error.

### Dashboard Backend

The application `backend_cocktail_dashboard` is a Flask-based web application, too, designed for real-time monitoring and analysis of cocktail-making robots. It fetches and streams data from the SQLite database handled in `persist_logs_in_sqite.py` to a dashboard, displaying statistics such as cocktail counts, ingredient usage, robot status, and failures. The application is structured around two main Flask routes: the dashboard view and a streaming endpoint for real-time updates. The dashboard serves as the user interface, displaying various statistics and the current status of cocktail-making robots. The stream endpoint continuously polls the database for new log entries, processes them, and sends updates to the dashboard via SSE.

#### Application Setup

The application defines a global Flask instance and specifies the path to the SQLite database that contains the log data. It also initializes two dictionaries, `last_activity_by_uuid` and `first_out_of_order_time`, to track the latest activity timestamps and the first occurrence of out-of-order status for each robot, respectively. This is required to mark robots that have stopped working, i.e. where the CPEE process has been stopped or deleted, as "** Out of Order **" after one minute and to remove them from the dashboard after five minutes of inactivity.

#### Endpoints

- Dashboard (`/`) serves the main dashboard page by rendering a template named `frontend_cocktail_dashboard.html`. The dashboard is the user interface where the real-time statistics and robot statuses are displayed.
- The Stream (`/stream`) endpoint is a generator function wrapped in a Flask `Response` object with the MIME type set to `text/event-stream`, enabling SSE. This endpoint is responsible for continuously querying the database for new log entries, processing the data, and sending updates to the client in real-time.

#### Key Functions

The `generate` function is the core of the streaming endpoint. It enters an infinite loop, periodically querying the database for new logs since the last processed entry. The function updates the various statistics of the dashboard. It then formats these statistics as JSON and yields them as SSE data to the client.

#### Real-time Data Processing

The application processes various types of events logged by the robots, such as cocktail orders (`calling` event type) and robot status updates. It tracks the number of cocktails made, the usage of individual ingredients, and instances of robot failures. The function also manages the status of each robot, marking robots as out of order if they have been inactive for more than a minute and removing them from the tracking list if the out-of-order status persists for more than five minutes.

#### Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for database operations and JSON parsing. It ensures that the application continues to run even if individual log entries contain malformed data. The streaming function uses a `try-except` block around database operations to handle any potential exceptions gracefully.

### Dashboard Frontend

The dashboard serves as a real-time monitoring interface for tracking the performance and activities of a cocktail robot system. It displays metrics such as the number of cocktails made, ingredients used, robot failures, and the current status of robots. Additionally, it includes visual representations of data through charts.

#### Structure and Style

##### HTML Structure

The HTML document is structured into several main components:

- Header: Displays the title of the dashboard and the last reset timestamp.
- Main Content: Comprises an image container and a dashboard container. The dashboard container includes sections for displaying key metrics and charts. The [image](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7LJWMU3PoQM/v1/-1x-1.jpg) used for the dashboard is available publically. 
- Footer: Shows the last update timestamp and information about the author.

##### CSS Styling

The styling defines a clean and modern look for the dashboard, with a focus on readability and clear data presentation. Key styling elements include:

- Background colors for the header and footer.
- Flexbox layout for positioning dashboard elements.
- Custom styles for dashboard metrics (cards) to highlight key data points.
- Chart containers styled to fit within the dashboard layout harmoniously.

#### Key Functions

##### JavaScript and EventSource

The dashboard leverages JavaScript to dynamically update its content based on real-time data streamed from the server:

- `EventSource`: Used to establish a persistent connection with the server, listening for updates sent to the `/stream` endpoint.
- Data Processing: Incoming data is parsed and used to update various parts of the dashboard, such as metrics, robot statuses, and charts.
- Charts: Utilizes `Chart.js` to display and update bar charts representing the number of cocktails made and the ingredients used.

##### Dynamic Updates

Key dynamic elements updated through JavaScript include:

- Cocktails Made and Ingredients Used: Metrics are displayed prominently and updated in real-time as data is received.
- Robot Failures: A counter indicating the number of times robots have encountered failures.
- Robot Status: Individual sections are dynamically added or removed based on the active status of each robot, displaying current activities or indicating if a robot is out of order.
- Charts: The cocktails and ingredients charts are updated with new data points as they arrive, providing a visual representation of the usage trends over time.

#### Real-time Data Processing

The dashboard is designed to handle real-time data efficiently:

- Event Handling: Listens for new data via the EventSource connection and updates the dashboard components accordingly.
- Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for the EventSource connection, logging errors to the console.
- Cleanup and Removal: Old data, such as inactive robot statuses, are removed from the dashboard to maintain relevance and clarity.
